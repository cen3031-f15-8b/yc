# About our Project 
Youth Combine is a non-profit organization that promotes health and fitness in children, with the ultimate goal of “eliminating childhood obesity.” In line with their goal of promoting a fitness community for youth, the leaders at Youth Combine want to make the world’s first social network and fitness application for action sports and fitness, specifically for youth.

For much of our front-end development, we used Bootstrap's available components and code. FOr more information about Bootstrap, you can visit their general website [here](http://getboostrap.com/).

Note: In order to fully integrate some Bootstrap components with AngularJS, we used the resources found in this GitHub repository [here](http://dhrmgddn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bootstrap.png).
