# About our Project 
Youth Combine is a non-profit organization that promotes health and fitness in children, with the ultimate goal of “eliminating childhood obesity.” In line with their goal of promoting a fitness community for youth, the leaders at Youth Combine want to make the world’s first social network and fitness application for action sports and fitness, specifically for youth.
